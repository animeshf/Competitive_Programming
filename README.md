# Competitive Programming

This repository contains solutions to selected problems from algorithmic programming competitions. It has been subdivided into three folders:

Algorithms: This contains everything from direct implementations of algorithms to solutions of interesting problems from competitions.

Codebook: This contains a slightly abridged version of the above folder, and mainly focuses on vanilla implementation of algorithms. It also contains the Georgia Tech ACM-ICPC Codebook.

Contests: I've added some contests that I did in the past year to this folder. I've done a few more since then, but I'm lazy so this is not really up to date.
