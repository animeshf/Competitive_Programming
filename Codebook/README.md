# Codebook for ACM-ICPC

This is a comprehensive collection of algorithms that might appear in an ACM-ICPC styled programming competition. This repository contains vanilla-implementations of several algorithms and also has some interesting problems which require unique ideas/tricks. It was used as the Georgia Tech Codebook for ACM South East Regionals in 2017.

Note that the PDF might not be up to date.
